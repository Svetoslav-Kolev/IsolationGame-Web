<h2>How To Play</h2>
<p>
    Isolation is a two-player abstract strategy board game. It is played on a 7x7 board which is initially filled with squares, except at the starting positions of the pieces. 
    Both players have one piece; it is in the middle position of the row closest to his/her side of the board.
    The starting position.

    A move consists of two subsequent actions:

    Moving one's piece to a neighboring (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) position that contains a square but not the opponent's piece
    Removing any square with no piece on it, similar to the arrow effect in Game of the Amazons.

    The player who cannot make any move loses the game.
